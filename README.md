##	RSLabel is a **Remote sensing image label tool.**


![markdown](https://github.com/enigma19971/RSLabel/blob/master/pic1.PNG "markdown")


##	How to Run it
this project is based on **labeme** ,PyQT5 and pygdal.   so the python3.6 env must be download and installed in the current folder.
you can using annaconda to download the python3.6 env and install PyQT5, gdal youself, and put it in the current folder
![Python Env](https://github.com/enigma19971/RSLabel/blob/master/python.PNG "like that")

we provide a package 

[python3.6 + PyGdal + PyQT5](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1h4soOEfQGFiTA88H1b8yuw)

After you download and unzip to you folder. you can the RSLabel.exe

##  get started!
- build overviews for images.  
for big images(larger than 300M), building overviews is highly recommended.

  you can chose build overviews for single file or a folder
- open the selected folder or a file
- begin to draw or edit the polygon using toolbar buttons

- when **drawing**, you can use **right click** to revoke the last point
- when **paning**, the **draw** and **edit** action are disabled.
- when **drawing** or **editing**, you can press **CTRL** button and drag the mouse to pan

-	Support Very large RS IMAGE
-	Supporting infinite zooming

##	the slant rectangle
this tool is very convinient to label object with an angle. look that

##	export the result as VOC or COCO format
you can export the result as VOC or COCO dataset's format , and use tensorflow or other deep learning framework to train the data.
